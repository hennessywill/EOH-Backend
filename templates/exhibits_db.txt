Hydrosystems Lab	Laboratory	"This educational sandbox + flow table model is all about hydrology. We can design a sandy landscape to increase or decrease surface runoff, ponding areas, and infiltration rates to recharge the underlying aquifers."	Civil and Environmental Engineering	Groundwater Hydrology	Hydrosystems Lab	Laboratory	"In this exhibit you can see how water flows underneath the Earth's surface. Just as water moves on the surface through rivers, lakes, and oceans, it is also constantly moving below the surface. Humans withdraw groundwater for irrigation, drinking water, and industrial applications; these withdrawals can impact Groundwater is essential for irrigation, human consumption, industry, and the streams."	Civil and Environmental Engineering	Tunnel and Reservoir Plan Model	Hydrosystems Lab	Laboratory	"As a very large and old city, Chicago still uses sewer pipes which contain both sanitary and stormwater flows; these are known as a combined sewers. Strong rainfall events may overload the urban drainage system, the rainfall excess may flood basements, streets and lower building levels. To mitigate these effects the City Of Chicago designed and built deep tunnels and gigantic reservoirs (TARP) where rainfall excess is storaged. In this manner engineers can regulate the inflows of sewage to the water treatment plans during extreme rainfall events. This MegaProject has reduced dramatically the frequency and volume of untreated sewer overflows discharged to the environment (Chicago River and Lake Michigan). U of I students have build a scaled model of TARP for one of our classes. Come and see what engineers can do to alleviate urban flooding hazards!"	Civil and Environmental Engineering	Hazards of Modern Spillway	Hydrosystems Lab	Laboratory	"Spillway dams are very common in Illinois, but very dangerous. Do you know why?"	Civil and Environmental Engineering	Tic-Tac-Tile Drainage	Hydrosystems Lab	Laboratory	"Tile drainage, or subsurface drainage, is the way farmers drain agricultural fields in order to improve crop growth. Although crops need rain, Illinois fields sometimes become too wet, and tile drains are used to quickly drain the extra water into ditches and streams. This exhibit demonstrates how tile drains can drain a field after a large rain event, and how much extra water is added to the streams. This extra water not only increases flow rates, but often has too many nutrients due to fertilizers and can cause water quality problems. Come see some old-fashioned and modern actual tile drains, and learn about how agricultural drainage works!"	Civil and Environmental Engineering	Wind Tunnel	Hydrosystems Lab	Laboratory	"This exhibit allows you to see flow patterns around objects (sphere,cars,wings).

Come to this exhibit to explore the fundamental properties of fluids through simple experiments.	Civil and Environmental Engineering	"Water, a resource balancing act"	Hydrosystems Lab	Laboratory	"We all see water and its many uses inside the home but there are important uses that we do not see. These uses include energy production, growing food, manufacturing, and many more. Due to the scarcity of fresh water there are often complications when deciding who gets to use it. This exhibit gives you the power to decide how to distribute a limited amount of water to a community and visualize the effects. Do you have what it takes to keep the town running?"	Civil and Environmental Engineering	Gravity Flows	Hydrosystems Lab	Laboratory	"Have you ever been to a beach and wondered how the sand got there? You can walk far out into the ocean and find endless amounts of sand, but how does it get there? Much of the sand we see in nature originated as mountains! In this exhibit, we show several mechanisms for how water moves sediment and how mountains can turn into the bottom of the ocean!"	Civil and Environmental Engineering	Salt vs. Cold  Double diffusion in our oceans	Hydrosystems Lab	Laboratory	"A sugar cube will dissolve when placed into a warm drink; when you drink it, it tastes as if the sugar is evenly mixed everywhere. This is accomplished through a process called diffusion, which attempts to evenly distribute a mixture. The same process happens with salt in water and, believe-it-or-not, with temperature as well. We have all heard that our oceans are salty, but did you know there is also vast temperature change below the surface? The sun heats the top layer of the ocean, but canï¿½t reach the bottom! This means the top layer is warm and more salty (due to evaporation!), while the lower layer is cold and less salty. Diffusion of dissolved salt and diffusion of temperature occur at different speeds, which creates some very interesting phenomena. Visit this exhibit for a fun example!"	Civil and Environmental Engineering	Salt Water Intrusion	Hydrosystems Lab	Laboratory	"The exhibit will show the dynamics of a salt water intrusion in a fresh water (river) system. Salt water intrusion usually occurs at the interface of a standing body of salt water (like a sea or an ocean) and a river flowing into it. Salt water, being heavier, plunges under the fresh water coming from the river. And even though the river flows into the sea/ocean, salt water moves up the river. In nature this process plays a major role in transportation of pollutants and nutrients at the fluvial-marine interface.  <--->For the exhibit, we will be using a straight flume  with a slope, in which fresh water would be pumped in slowly from one end and taken out from the other, thus depicting an idealized river. The end from which fresh water would be taken out, will also have salt water (colored with a dye). Initially the Salt water would be stopped from intruding upstream using a gate, and the fresh water would be flowing over it. To show the intrusion, the gate would be suddenly removed. "	Civil and Environmental Engineering	Where does the rain go?	Hydrosystems Lab	Laboratory	"Hydrology, in a nutshell, is studying where rain goes. Rain follows the topography of the landscape until it reaches the ocean. Sometimes it takes a short time to get there (runoff), sometimes it takes a long time (groundwater storage or snow), and sometimes it never reaches it (evaporation or transpiration). In this interactive model, you will see how rainfall is routed in streams and rivers at multiple scales. Your mouse is the storm cloud, and with a click of the mouse you will be able to dump rain anywhere in the United States!"	Civil and Environmental Engineering	Urban flooding	Hydrosystems Lab	Laboratory	"hat is a floodplain and how they are strongly affected by human activities?

Civil and Environmental Engineering	Wave action	Hydrosystems Lab	Laboratory	How does the flow look like in the deep ocean?

Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering	Making Science Crystal Clear	Loomis Lab	Atrium	"We are making various types of crystals to teach about the structure, properties, and natural occurrences of crystals. Additionally, the application of crystals to chemical engineering will be taught as well. We are also planning on passing out borax and rock crystals to the kids."

Distillation is the core of chemical engineering and is used in the production of nearly every chemical product; from food and water to gasoline and plastic! <--->Continuous distillation is an ongoing separation process in which a liquid mixture of two or more miscible components is continuously fed into the process and physically separated into two or more products by preferentially boiling the more volatile (i.e., lower boiling point) components out of the mixture. - (Wikipedia) <--->The exhibit itself will consist of a small scale distillation column that will be used to separate water and food coloring. The column will be made of transparent plexiglass so that the the audience can see the separation take place. <--->The column will then be decorated so that it looks like a part of a modern chemical plant!"	Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering	N/ALiquid Nitrogen Ice Cream	Loomis Lab	Atrium	We will be making ice cream in the form of small spheres (like Dippin' Dots) with liquid nitrogen.	Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering	Edible Water Bottles	Loomis Lab	Atrium	"Want a meal and a drink in one? Or care to flavor your water like your lunch? No? Well, we tried it anywaysï¿½"		Don't Talk About Soap Manufacturing	Loomis Lab	Atrium	"In the book and movie Fight Club, a large scale process is used to manufacture soap and nitroglycerin (as a byproduct). However, the actual process used is never properly explained, so we are trying to create a valid manufacturing process that these domestic terrorists could have used, with the same restrictions."
